    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding
of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness.
I created a geometric animation in which it presents the user with a satisfying visual pattern. 
this type of animation consists of a overlapping rectangualar pattern which has different sizes colours and shapes 
that are presented every second as the animation features are in a constant roatation.
As you can see in the animation there is a faded colour from black to red this looks aesthetically pleasing for a user to look at.
